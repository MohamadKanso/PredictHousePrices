# 🏡 Multiple Linear Regression: House Price Prediction 📈

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of multiple linear regression for predicting house prices based on feature data. The implementation was created as a solution to a programming challenge that focuses on estimating house prices per square foot using normalised feature values.

## 🔍 Problem Description
Charlie, a prospective homebuyer, has collected detailed data about houses in his target area. He has:
- 🏠 Quantified and normalised various house features on a scale
- 💵 Collected actual price per square foot for some houses
- 📊 Needs to predict prices for houses where pricing is unknown
- 📐 Data shows an approximately linear relationship between features and price
