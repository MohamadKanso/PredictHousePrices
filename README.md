# Multiple Linear Regression: House Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of multiple linear regression for predicting house prices based on feature data. The implementation was created as a solution to a programming challenge that focuses on estimating house prices per square foot using normalized feature values.

## Problem Description
Charlie, a prospective homebuyer, has collected detailed data about houses in his target area. He has:
- Quantified and normalized various house features on a scale
- Collected actual price per square foot for some houses
- Needs to predict prices for houses where pricing is unknown
- Data shows approximately linear relationship between features and price

## Implementation Details
The solution implements multiple linear regression from scratch in C++ using:
- Custom `LinearRegression` class
- Feature centering for numerical stability
- Normal equation method for coefficient calculation
- Direct solution for 2x2 system of equations
- Proper handling of intercept terms

### Key Components
```cpp
class LinearRegression {
    private:
        vector<double> theta;  // Model coefficients
        
    public:
        void fit(const vector<vector<double>>& X, const vector<double>& y);
        double predict(const vector<double>& x) const;
};
```

## Usage
### Input Format
```
F N          // F: number of features, N: number of training examples
x11 x12 y1   // Training data: F features followed by price
x21 x22 y2
...
Q            // Q: number of query houses
q11 q12      // Query data: F features for each house
q21 q22
...
```

### Example
```
Input:
2 7
0.18 0.89 109.85
1.0 0.26 155.72
0.92 0.11 137.66
0.07 0.37 76.17
0.85 0.16 139.75
0.99 0.41 162.6
0.87 0.47 151.77
4
0.49 0.18
0.57 0.83
0.56 0.64
0.76 0.18

Output:
105.22
142.68
132.94
129.71
```

### Compilation and Running
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 house_price_prediction.cpp -o predict
./predict < input.txt
```

## Technical Details
The implementation uses:
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Vector operations for matrix calculations
- Data centering for improved numerical stability
- Fixed-point output formatting for price predictions

### Requirements
- C++11 or higher
- Standard C++ libraries

## Algorithm
1. Center the training data by subtracting means
2. Calculate covariance matrices
3. Solve normal equations for coefficients
4. Include intercept term in predictions
5. Output predictions with 2 decimal places
